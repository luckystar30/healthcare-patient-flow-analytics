**Healthcare Patient Flow & Capacity Optimization Analytics**

**Overview**

Hospitals operate under constant pressure to reduce patient wait times, optimize bed capacity, and improve care quality—often without additional resources.
This project analyzes end-to-end patient flow, from admission to discharge, to uncover operational inefficiencies and quantify opportunities to improve throughput and capacity using data-driven insights.

**Tech Stack:** BigQuery · SQL · Python · Looker Studio

**Business Problems**

- Healthcare operations teams commonly face:

- Prolonged patient wait times during peak hours

- Inefficient bed utilization across departments

- Discharge delays that block new admissions

- Elevated 30-day readmission rates

- Limited visibility into system-wide bottlenecks

This project addresses these challenges by transforming raw admission and discharge events into actionable operational metrics.

**Project Objectives**

- Analyze patient movement across departments

- Measure and optimize Length of Stay (LOS)

- Quantify bed occupancy and throughput

- Identify high-risk readmission patterns

- Simulate capacity improvements without adding beds

**Key Outcomes & Insights**

1) Identified departments contributing disproportionately to delayed discharges

2) Quantified peak vs off-peak bed utilization patterns

3) Demonstrated that a 10–15% LOS reduction can significantly increase patient throughput without additional capacity

4) Highlighted patient segments with higher readmission risk to support targeted interventions

**Data Description**

The project uses synthetic / anonymized healthcare data to ensure privacy and safety.

**Core entities include:**

- Patient ID (anonymized)

- Admission and discharge timestamps

- Department / unit

- Diagnosis category

- Bed ID

- 30-day readmission flag

- Derived Length of Stay (LOS)

The dataset structure mirrors real hospital operational data commonly found in EHR and CMS-style systems.

**Architecture Overview**

Raw CSV Files
→ Ingested into BigQuery (raw datasets)
→ Transformed using SQL (patient flow, utilization, readmissions)
→ Materialized Analytics Tables
→ Validated and enhanced with Python (data quality, features, simulations)
→ Visualized in Looker Studio Dashboards
